# Sorting Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C. Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science for arranging elements of a list in a particular order.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. **Selection Sort**: Selection sort is another simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

3. **Insertion Sort**: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time. It iterates through the list, removing one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the list.

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own C file. You can compile and run each implementation separately using a C compiler such as GCC.

### Example Compilation:

```bash
gcc bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
```

### Example Execution:

```bash
./bubble_sort
```

Replace `bubble_sort` with the respective file name for other sorting algorithms.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an implementation of a sorting algorithm in C that you would like to add, feel free to submit a pull request.
